Hello World,

 I'm Phil and welcome to my homepage. Some facts about me:
I'm so lazy that I host my homepage on blogger.com, instead of "hardcoring" on  github, like all the cool guys do
I do software professionally starting from 2003. Please see  my resume.
I came from  Microsoft world, but I'm diving deeper and deeper into the world of opensource and I  it.
I am Full stack engineer and I like keeping and developing my skills in all directions: front end, back end and databases. Though I have a bit more passion for the front end.
I prefer to work on  web projects (ideally high traffic and distributed), however I did a lot of windows desktop apps (WPF, WinForms). As a developer my strongest skills right now are HTML, Javascript ES6, React, .NET C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL, but I'd love to master something new, like GoLang, C++, Java, Python, Mobile apps etc...
I love learning new stuff (not limited to software development or even tech). I get bored if I don't do it.
I have experience in project management (Agile, Scrum), using and customizing different tools and platforms (Jira, Ms Project, Team Foundation Server,...).
I live in Jersey City, NJ and I hate driving, which limits my work location to New York City and Jersey City
Sometimes I post my profession-related ideas here in  the blog (not too often unfortunately).
I have the following fields of interest:
 Start ups & entrepreneurship & partnership & impact
 Financial industry - investment markets, algorithmic trading, risk management, quantitative development 
 Web technologies, high traffic customer facing web/mobile apps
 Machine learning, AI, Tensorflow 
 Leadership & management
